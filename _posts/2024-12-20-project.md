## Meet the team of passionate beer lovers

We are a group of students passionate about brewing, and eager to launch our first beer. We have therefore taken it upon ourselves to look at beer reviews, find the customer needs and succeed in our market entry. For this, we will first observe the global beer landscape to see how satisfied the customers are with the current market and if an entry is possible. In this case, we will analyse the favourable characteristics of the products in order to multiply our chances of a successful market entry. Once we have our product, we will develop a launch strategy containing A DAta-driven communication plan and launch schedule. All in all, we want to determine how to make the most successful newcomer beer!

## Understanding the Global Beer Landscape

### Beer datasets

Our analysis relies on three main datasets coming from corresponding websites :
- BeerAdvocate
- RateBeer
- Beerizer which includes itself also the Untappd dataset

BeerAdvocate and RateBeer are websites where users can leave ratings on beers. Giving us access to all those ratings. There is also data coming from Beerizer which is selling a large selection of beers, having at the same time corresponding average ratings from Untappd, a different beer rating website similar to the two previous ones. Beerizer enables us to have a real analysis on selling prices depending on beer characteristics. We also have a matched dataset with beers appairing on RateBeer and BeerAdvocate, as well as between the three websites.

Furthermore, three other datasets have been used to enrich our analysis and be able to normalise the results. 
- The population per country in the world from [world bank group](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?end=2012&start=2008)
- The list of countries by beer consumption from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_beer_consumption_per_capita)
- Median income per year (after tax) from [Our World in Data](https://www.lisdatacenter.org)

Since countries population can vary a lot in size and not all of them use platforms like Beerizer, RateBeer, or Beer Advocate, the datasets above help us take a closer look at the stats and better compare countries, even if theyâ€™re not the same size.

#### General overview


Let's first see general statitics to be able to compare our datasets. Looking at ratings distribution, we can see significant differences. Beerizer and BeerAdvocate are comparable with mean/median around 3.75, even if BeerAdvocate distribution is steeper. RateBeer's users on the other hand are harsher on the ratings having a mean/median only around 3.0 with a low standard deviation. These differences need to be taken into account in the following analysis.

#### USA bias 

As we can clearly see, most of users are from the USA. Meaning a potential strong bias in the ratings.

By normalizing the number of ratings by the population, we get a more realistic plot. In the following analysis, we normalised multiple time, depending on the case, once by the number of inhabitants and for the total consumption of beer of the country.

## Newcomers Analysis 
For a useful analysis of the success of a newcomer beer, it is important to first identify the newcomers in question. The dataset contains beers with different numbers of reviews per beer. Each review was written in a specific place at a specific time. The easiest way to identify newcomers would be to simply search for the first review given to a beer. However, this does not take into account the fact that there were fewer reviews of beers in the beginning. Worse, it is likely that a first review does not automatically coincide with a product launch. A less common beer, or one that's only available in regions where reviews are scarce, would get its first review months or years after launch. Including such a beer in the newcomer analysis would be inappropriate.

In order to ensure a more comprehensible selection of newcomer beers, several strategies were tested. First, two data sets can be considered independent in terms of reviewer population and beer opinion. If different reviewers give a beer its first review on both sites within a short period of time, this beer is likely to have experienced a surge in popularity, probably due to its launch in at least one new region. Secondly, it is possible to filter out beers that are simply not newcomers, since their first review was given in the first year of the site's launch. These can be considered the most established beers on the site, so they can be valuable in comparing the newcomer beers with established competitors. Thirdly, the review texts can be used to validate newcomer beers. Certain keywords such as "newcomer" and "new product" can be used to find beers that are very likely to be new beers. After testing all these strategies, only a few newcomer beers could be identified with certainty. However, the results can be used to confirm the validity of other methods, as most of the real newcomers should be found by more than one detection method.

<img src="/assets/img/md/DensityBeers.png" alt="density beers">

This brings us to the last method. Trend analysis (Fig. xxx) of beer reviews can reduce the risk of less popular beers being classified as new beers even though they are rarely reviewed. By comparing the number of reviews in the year following the first review with the total number of reviews assigned, we can find the beers with a sudden spike in reviews. This spike should be a strong indication of a sudden increase in interest in a beer. The most likely explanation for a sudden increase in interest is the case we are looking for: A new beer came on the market, was bought and reviewed.




<img src="/assets/img/md/TextBeerPre2008.png" alt="text beer pre 2008">

<img src="/assets/img/md/TextBeerPost2008.png" alt="text beer post 2008">


Taking the likely newcomer beers to the review text analysis, we end up with few matches. This is due to the restrictions placed on candidates for the review density analysis of having at least 5 reviews. Only 16 of the 29 likely newcomers could be represented in the density analysis. The first 7 beers received their review quite early, at a time when there were far fewer reviews on RA and BA in general. They are likely to have been launched long before they received their first review and are an established brand. These reviews don't spike in the beginning, sometimes they spike later, like the Alesmith Speedway Stout. On the other hand, the 9 beers that received their first review after 2008 show exactly the behaviour expected of a newcomer, with a sudden early spike in reviews and a decreasing number of reviews over time. This gives a high level of confidence in the method.

In this way we end up with 9 beers that are almost certainly newcomers. Based on these 9 beers alone, it is difficult to do further analysis. Instead, we need to broaden our view to get a better understanding of the beer landscape, while keeping in mind what kind of beers have already been successful.


## Which country would be ideal for launching our beer ?
This analysis is critical, as it is expensive to promote and advertise our company, we have to carefully analyse the market to identify the best country for a successful launch. 
Many criterias are important! 
- The consumption of beer per inhabitant is of course a major argument, 
- The number of breweries present in this region, to see if the market is saturated or if newcomers are welcomed
- Finally, the identity of the customers plays a role:
    - Are they strict when it comes to grading beers?
    - Are they open to trying new breweries, or do they stubbornly remain loyal to their favorite beer?

<!-- interactive map -->


From the plots with the data from wikipedia, we can see that in consumption per inhabitant the eastern europeans are have the lead with the Czech Republic, Austria, Romania, Germany and Poland in the Top 5 with arount 95L of beer consummed per inhabitant per year. And notibly 16 european countries are present in the top 20. 



### Correlating the number of ratings per user with the consumption of beer for each country

<img src="/assets/img/md/plot1_nbr_beer_consumersvswiki.png" alt="plot1 number beer consumer">



<img src="/assets/img/md/plot1_nbr_beer_consumersvswiki_nbr_ratings.png" alt="plot1 number beer consumer nbr rating">


The main takeaway from the graph and the calculated correlation is that there's a very strong link between the number of inhabitants and the total amount of beer drank by country, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94. This means that the two are clearly linked: countries with larger populations tend to drink more beer overall.

This seems obvious, as more people means more potential beer drinkers. Nevertheless, cultural and income factors may also have had an impact, but from this correlation we can see that the main factor is the number of inhabitants! Of course, there may be some exceptions, for example in some countries where alcohol consumption is prohibited.

The second takeaway confirms what we saw before: the RB and BA datasets are not fully representative and may contain some misinterpretations or errors.
- First and foremost, there is once again the huge US bias, which contradicts the consumption per country from the Wikipedia dataset, which we take as the "ground truth" after comparing some values with [another dataset](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-beer-consumption-per-capita-by-country/) .
- Secondly, many countries simply don't use these rating apps, so the data for these countries may be less relevant in some cases.
- Finally, some countries have unrealistic data, sometimes due to not enough users to get a realistic average, sometimes likely due to bots. During pre-processing, such users have of course been removed, but fake accounts may still remain. In this particular case, users with more than 1000 reviews have been removed, which removes about 1% for Beer Advocate and about 2.5% for RateBeers.

### Is there place for a new beer company or is the market already saturated
For redundancy, we study multiple  and datasets.. 

- The first one being the Ratio : 


<img src="/assets/img/md/ratio.png" alt="mathematical equation">


which uses the number of breweries from the the rb and ba dataset, and the information on each country from wikipedia.

- The second one being the analysis of the number of breweries vs number of consumers, both informations only from the ba and rb dataset.


<img src="/assets/img/md/figure3.png" alt="breweries vs nbr users">


The second plot can be interpreted this way : 
If the country is below the redline, it tends to be better. 
Indeed there is the number of breweries s y axis and the number of consumers as x axis. And when the country is positioned bellow the redline it means that there could be a free market available for us there ! 
For some countries it usually means that the country likes foreign beer and tend to import a lot of beers.

## Choosing the right market
Choosing the right place to start is a difficult task. One way to get a solid, non-industrial business off the ground is to get a compelling margin on every sale. Where are people most willing to spend more of the country's median income on expensive beer? Remember that producing beer in a location with a lower median income also makes cheaper production costs likely. Countries that share the same market (e.g. EU) or neighbouring countries are relevant for further growth.

<div id="sylvain_mean_euro"></div>


### Average beer price adjusted to the median country's income


<div id="sylvain_norm_income_score"></div>


Values on this map were calculated by dividing the average beer price in each country by the median income of each inhabitant. Each of the two values were normalised before the calculation in order to have similar weigths between each input. Looking at this map, we can see that beers don't cost much for the average person in Western countries. No country stands out as the best place to launch a beer based on this metric alone, as long as it is a Western country, which is not too surprising. 


### Choosing the country for the production 

As good business owners, we want to maximise our profits. Paying our employees too much is not the best way. But we don't want to exploit them. Instead, we want to locate our production in a country with low wages. At the same time, the country's reputation for beer craftsmanship is very important, as even our almost perfect beer will take time to change decades of a priori opinions. Looking at the data, we see a clear winner here: Serbia, or more generally eastern countries.


<div id="sylvain_income_avg_rating"></div>


### Decision matrix for our countries choice
### Final country choice
Here we will choose our intial country based on 5 weights: in the order of the most important to the least, we have : 
1. consumption per inhabitant per year wikipedia is of course the most important criteria for us with a weight of **40** for this criteria.
2. income average rating per inhabitant with a weight of **20** for this criteria.
3. the ratio of consumers/breweries with a weight of **15** for this criteria.
4. the ratio of the average price by the average income with a weight of **15** for this criteria.
5. the mean grade that is attributed by each user with a weight of **10** for this criteria.

### Beer type choice

The ideal style of beer to brew in order to be successful obviously needs to be well appreciated by the public, but at the same time not too mainstream to avoid oversaturated markets. For this reason, we looked at the best average score for each beer style having between 5 and 100 ratings in the Beerizer dataset.



<img src="/assets/img/md/under_represented_styles.png" alt="under represented styles">

In conclusion, one of the top 5 beers might be good choices with **Quadruple IPA** being the best one by a good margin.

select country: <select id="box_plot_selector_country"></select>



## When should we launch our beer ? 
### Global seasonal trend

Finding the perfect launch date is a complex task. People don't drink the same amount of beer all year round. Finding the right time to catch the seasonal wave would be perfect. The time a review is given is closely related to the time the beer was drunk. So looking at the number of reviews over the course of the year shows us the potential seasonal trends.

Looking at this graph, we can see a small but long uptrend during summer. But the most important peak is at the end of the end, in November/December. In general, we would like to launch our product a bit before the uptrend period, but this can also be different depending on the type of beer. 


<!-- an interactive plot showing our findings -->
<div id="time_series_ratings"></div>
select dataset:<select id="time_series_dataset_selector"></select> select beer type:<select id="time_series_type_selector"></select>

So our ideal launch would be in April which is a perfect month, as its the start of longer and sunny days !

## Beer name generator 

Finally, we used the data harvested during our journey to create efficient new beer names inspired by the best. Creating a Markov chain model with the available beer names and their related ratings depending on the origin. In the end, we have a simple name generator for countries with enough data points.

*Note: Beer names were precomputed*
