# Beer stats ADA
This repo contains the project work we did for the ADA class. For our project we decided to gain insight into how to classify beers and we presented our results under the form of a website available at owhenthesaints.github.io/beerstatsada.github.io. This website contains many interactive graphs and presents our findings in an intuitive manner.
